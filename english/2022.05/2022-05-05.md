## English
Ohio held its own mid-term election on 
May 3rd, following Texas's primary, with
separate primaries. The race was seen as a 
test of Mr Trump's influence in the 
Republican Party after he leaves the 
presidency, but Mr Vance, backed by Mr Trump,
lived up to his expectations and won the Republican primary.
