The cost of food and fuel in the U.K. has
risen sharply, with inflation reaching 9%
in April -- the highest in 40 years. The 
same month, millions of families saw their
annual energy bills jump by 54%,
amounting to an extra 700 Pounds
(US$ 863)a year on average for each
household. More British turn to food 
banks as bills soar.
