## English
Investing in start-ups may bring greater
innovation potential and return on
investment, but it also comes with higher
risks and uncertainties. Investing in tech
giants can leverage their resources and 
brand power, but may be limited by the
pace of innovation and competition. The
best investment strategy may be to strike a
balance between the two.
