## English
People who got their exercise in the form
of popular team sports -- soccer, tennis,
volleyball, basketball, softball, etc. --
reported the lowest self-reported mental
health burden. "Reinforcing social bonds,
getting people to focus on objectives that
are beyond themselves, and providing
opportunities to win" will be beneficial to
mental health.
