## English
A 40-year-old man whose legs were
paralyzed in a cycling accident 12 years ago
can walk again thanks to implants in his
brain and spinal cord. The brain-spine
interface(BSI) has remained stable for a
year, allowing Gert-Jan Oskam to stand,
walk, climb stairs and traverse complex
terrains, according to a study published
Wednesday in the journal Nature.
