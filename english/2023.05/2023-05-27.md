## English
Waking up early is a habit that can
positively impact productivity, mental
well-being, and overall success. By
implementing a consistent sleep schedule,
creating a bedtime routine, and
incorporating an alarm clock with morning
rituals, we will be able to establish a
successful early morning routine.
Remember, the key to becoming an early
riser lies in consistency and determination.
