## English
Once you get past five hours of vigorous
exercise per week or so, you're not 
exercising for health, you're exercising for
performance. And it's possible to stress
your body beyond what it can bounce back
from, said Kristen Dieffenbach, an exercise
scientist. When the stress from your 
workouts builds up beyond your capacity
to recover, you have entered the zone of
too much overtraining.
