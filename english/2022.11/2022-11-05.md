## English
Small businesses are stocking the shelves
early this holiday season and waiting to see
how many gifts inflation-weary shoppers
feel like giving. Holiday shopping was 
relatively strong during the past two years
as shoppers flocked online to spend, aided
by pandemic stimulus dollars. This year,
small businesses are bracing for a more
muted season, as some Americans spend more
cautiously.
