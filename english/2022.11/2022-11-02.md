## English
One real-world study from investigators at 
Florida State University found that women
who ate 75 grams of dried apple(that's about 
two medium-sized apples) every day for one 
year lowered their levels of unhealthy LDL
cholesterol by 24%.(Elevated LDL is one of 
the most reliable risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease.)
