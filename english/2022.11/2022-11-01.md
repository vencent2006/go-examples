## English
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory
managed to capture a similiarly spooky
image of the sun. On Wednesday, the 
agency shared a capture of the sun "smiling".
As the Guardian points out, more than a few
Twitter users were quick to point out how the
star looks like a carved pumpkin in NASA's image.
There's a bit of interesting science behind the 
resemblance.
