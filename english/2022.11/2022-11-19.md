## English
"The ideas of improving wellness through
our indoor spaces is something that has 
burgeoned," Jean Whitehead, senior
lecturer in Interior Design at Falmouth
University, tells BBC Culture. "It was
already prevalent in healthcare interiors,
but now it's crossing over into hospitality
and leisure spaces, as well as we think 
about our homes."
