## English
Blood that has been grown in a laboratory
has been put into people in a world-first
clinical trial, UK researchers say.
If the blood is not a precise match then the
body starts to reject it and the treatment fails.
This level of tissue-matching goes beyond the 
well-known A, B, AB and O blood groups.
