## English
Every year, UK-based international air
transport rating organisation Skytrax
surveys travelers from around the globe to
compile its list of the best airports in the 
world, and for 2024 the honor goes to
Qatar's airport, which is known for its
ultra-modern design, easy-to-navigate
terminals and high-end shopping.
Singapore(SIN) had the title in 2023 and
2020, while Doha(DOH) took the gong in
2022 and 2021.
