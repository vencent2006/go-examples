## English
A bill that would force a sale of TikTok by
its Chinese owner, ByteDance - or ban it
outright - was passed by the Senate on
Tuesday and signed into law Wednesday
by President Biden. The law would allow
TikTok to continue to operate in the
United States if ByteDance sold it within
270 days, or about nine months, a time
frame that the president could extend to a year.
