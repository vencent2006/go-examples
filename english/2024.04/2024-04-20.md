## English
A report published by the American
Cancer Society in Janary suggests that
rates of colorectal cancer are rising rapidly
among the American people in their 20s,
30s and 40s -- even as incidence is
declining in people over the age of 65.
In fact, experts are noticing a rise in early-
onset colorectal cancers around the world.
