Donald Trump, who is currently leading
the incumbent US President Joe Biden in
several nationwide and swing state polls,
has declined to endore a national

procedure should be left up to the states.
The abortion issue has divided the US
electorate and supercharged Democratic
electoral successes in recent years.
