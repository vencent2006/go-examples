## English
The so-called "China overcapacity"
narrative has been employed by certain
Western countries, primarily the United
States, as a political tool to tarnish and
suppress the Chinese economy, the
observers said. Behind the slander lies an
agenda of anti-globalization and
protectionism that ultimately hinders
normal global trade and undermines the
common interests of nations, they said.
