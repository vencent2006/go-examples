## English
Brushing your teeth effectively lowers your
chances of getting a host of chronic
diseases, as well as keeping your teeth and 
gums healthy. But the majority of us are
doing it wrong. The most important place
to remove bacteria from is not in fact the
teeth, but the gumline. This is where
microbes are best able to infiltrate the gum
tissue and cause inflammation, and
eventually conditions such as periodontitis.
