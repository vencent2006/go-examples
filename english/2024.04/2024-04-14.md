## English
NetEase said that it had reached the new
deal with Microsoft's Blizzard
Entertainment, restoring access to popular
video games like World of Warcraft for
Chinese gamers. More than a year ago,
NetEase and Blizzard called an end to their
long-running partnership when renewal
talks turned testy. Blizzard was acquired
by Microsoft in a $69 billion deal in October.
