A unique course at Peking University is
helping students get into shape in a big
way. Titled "Physical Fitness
Enhancement: Exercise and Nutrition,"
the class is only open to students with a
body mass index over 25 - meaning they
are overweight or obese. The selective
admission requirements attracted many
students to enter the lottery for the limited
class slots.
