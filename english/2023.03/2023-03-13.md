## English
Research shows that spending money to 
free up time(a pratice called buying time)
can reduce time stress, boost happiness,
and improve your relationships. You might
pay to outsource a disliked chore, get a 
direct flight instead of a cheaper one with a 
layover, or pay a toll to drive the fastest
route home. Then, invest your windfall of
free time in something socially engaging.
