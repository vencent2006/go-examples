## English
Since ChatGPT's launch in November,
a mini-industry has defied the broader
slump in tech. Not a week goes by without
someone unveiling a "generative" artificial
intelligence(AI) based on "foundation"
models--the vast and complex algorithms
that give ChatGPT and other AIs like it
their wits.
