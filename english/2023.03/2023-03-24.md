Yes.
Could you give me your passport, please?
Here you are.
OK. Here is your room card. It's on the 5th floor, room 509. The elevator is over there.
Thank you. By the way, where is the dinning room?
The dinning room is on the 2nd floor.
What time can I have breakfast?
From 6 am to 10 am.
Ok. Could I have a card with the hotel address?
Of course.Here you are.
And where is the nearest subway station?

It's a pleasure. Enjoy your stay!
