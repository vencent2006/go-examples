## English
Changing the world is hard; changing the 
language is a lot easier. For example,
"handicapped" was a kinder replacement
for "cripple", and "homeless" for
"vagrant". Now "handicapped" is out and
"disabled" is in (or, better yet, "person
with a disability").



## words
* handicapped: 残障人
* crippled: 瘸子
* homeless: 无家可归
* vagrant: 乞丐
* disable: 残疾人
