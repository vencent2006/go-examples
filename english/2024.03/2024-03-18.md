## English
Last year South Korea experienced
significant demographic shifts which were
characterised by declines in marriage. The
number of marriages recorded in 2023
was 193673 while it was 322,807 in 2013-
which shows a decrease of 40 percent
within a decade. Financial concerns,
notably the cost of wedding expense and
housing, are the primary barriers to 
marriage for many South Koreans in their
20s and 30s.
