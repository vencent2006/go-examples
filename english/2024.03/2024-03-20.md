## English
Boeing has told airlines to check the 
cockpit seats of its 787 Dreamliner plane
after a Latam Airlines plane suddenly
plunged on a flight to Auckland, New Zealand,
on Monday, injuring passengers.
The drop in altitude appears to have been
caused when a flight attendant hit a switch
on a seat that sent a pilot into the plane's
controls. Aviation regulators are
investigating the incident and have not
released any findings.
