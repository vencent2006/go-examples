## English
We often seek food after focused mental
activity, like preparing for an exam.
Researchers speculate that heavy bouts of
thinking drain energy from the brain,
whose capacity to store fuel is very limited.
So the brain, sensing that it may soon
require more calories to keep going,
apparently stimulates bodily hunger, and
even though there has been little in the
way of physical movement or caloric
expenditure, we eat.
