## English
The exit by Nikki Haley from the
Republican primary after a string of
resounding losses on Super Tuesday
assured former President Donald J.Trump
of his party's nomination, kicking off a 
general election contest with President
Biden that both sides expect will be bitter,
brutal and long. The matchup that many
Americans had hoped to avoid - the 2024
sequel of Biden vs. Trump - is now an
inescapable reality.
