## English
Brussels has fined Apple â‚¬1.8bn for stifling
competition from rival music streaming
services, the first time the iPhone maker
has been punished for breaching EU law.
Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition
chief, said the tech giant had broken EU
antitrust rules for a decade by "restricting
developers from income consumers
about alternative, cheaper music services
available outside of the Apple ecosystem".
