## English
The House on Wednesday passed a bill
with board bipartisan support that would
force ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner
to either sell the hugely popular video app
or have it banned in the United States. The
action came despite TikTok's efforts to
mobilize its 170 million U.S. users against
the measure.
