## English
As the temperature gradually rises, black-
necked cranes have started their migration
from the reservoir in Lhunzhub County of
Lhasa, southwest China's Xizang
Autonomous Region. The black-necked
crane, a species under first-class state
protection in China, mainly inhabits
plateau meadows and marshes at an
altitude of 2,500 to 5,000 meters.
