## English
If you want to look your best in the
morning, it may be worth swapping the 
ultra-processed pastries and fruit juice for
wholemeal toast and tea without sugar.
Researchers in France found that people
who ate a breakfast rich in refined
carbohydrates were rated less attractive
than those who started the day with
healthier unrefined carbs.
