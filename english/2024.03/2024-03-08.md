China will adopt a visa-free policy for
Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria,
Belgium and Luxembourg on a trial basis,
starting March 14, Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi said Thursday. "We
hope more countries will also offer
Chinese citizens visa facilitation and work
with us to build fast-track networks for
cross-border travels and encourage speedy
resumption of international passenger
flights. This will make it more convenient
for Chinese citizens to travel abroad, and
make foreign friends feel at home in
China," he said.
