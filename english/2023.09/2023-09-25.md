## English
communicate your decision clearly:
You don't need to go into extensive detail
about your reasons, but you can provide a
brief explanation if you feel
comfortable. Keep it short: There's no need
for long-winded explanations. Keeping
your message brief - a few sentences at
most -- is sufficient.

## words
* winded explanation: 冗长的解释
