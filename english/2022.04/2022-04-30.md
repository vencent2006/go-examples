The U.S.-China Business Council said that there is no reason to maintain  the additional tariffs
on Chinese products imposed during Donald Trump's presidency and 
eliminating them will lower prices for many consumer goods amid high inflation.
It urged President Joe Biden's administration to ease tariffs on
Chinese goods.
