## English
Studies have shown that shoppers prefer
to buy clothing labeled with small sizes
because it boots our confidence. So as the
weight of the average American woman
rose, from 140 lb in 1960 to 168.5 lb in
2014, brands adjusted their metrics to help
more of us squeeze into more-desirable
sizes(and get us to buy more clothes).

## words
* boost: 提升
* metric: 尺码度量
* squeeze into: 挤进去
