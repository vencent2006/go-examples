## English
The only way to be truly confident is to 
simply become comfortable with what you
lack. I wish I wasn't balding. "I wish I was
more athletic." "It'd be nice if I wasn't so 
absentiminded all the time." Let go of the
hold your flaws have on you. You just gotta
tell yourself that these things aren't going
to change and that you're better off being
you, as you are because that's all you can be.
