## English
The EU has pushed ahead with tariffs of
up to 45 per cent on Chinese electric
vehicles, sharply escalating the trade war
between the 27-memeber bloc and Beijing.
The tariffs will be imposed for five years.
The new duties also came on top of an
existing 10 per cent tariff on Chinese car
imports in the bloc.
