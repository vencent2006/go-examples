## English
Scientists in Colombia say they have
developed a new food substance that
protects bees from dangerous chemicals
used in farming. As pollinators, bees are
extremely important in the preservation of 
natural ecosystems and food production.
The plant-based food substance enables
bees to deal with neurotoxins commonly
used in agriculture. It protects their motor
system and memory harmed by the chemicals.
