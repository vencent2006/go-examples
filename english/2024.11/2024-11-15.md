## English
Starting November 15th, the site of
Pompeii in southern Italy will start
limiting visitors to just 20,000 a day in an
effort to combat mass tourism. Visitors
will also have to buy personalized tickets
with their names on them in an effort to 
stop travel groups from buying up tickets
to sell at higher prices. The new regulation
comes after a record summer of visitors
with peaks of over 36,000.
