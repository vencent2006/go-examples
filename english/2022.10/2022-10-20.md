## English
UK food prices are rising at their fastest
rate in 42 years as the cost of living crisis
continues to squeeze household budgets.
Food costs jumped 14.6% in the year to September
- the biggest rise since 1980 - with bread, cereal,
meat and dairy prices all climbing. It comes as
people also struggle with higher energy and transport
costs.
