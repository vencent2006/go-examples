## English
In recent years, stressed-out urbanites
have been seeking refuge in green spaces
for the proven positive impacts on physical
and mental health, but the benefits of 
"blue space" -- the sea and coastline, but
also rivers, lakes, canals, waterfalls, even
fountains -- are less well publicised, yet
the science has been consistent for at least
a decade: being by water is good for body and mind.
