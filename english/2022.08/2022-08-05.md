## English
How much money do you need to lead
your "absolutely ideal life"? The answer for
most people, according to new research by 
university psychologists, is $10m. A
growing coalition of politicians and 
opinion formers are calling for the 
introduction of wealth taxes across the 
world to help close the "staggering" gap
between the richest and poorest in society.
