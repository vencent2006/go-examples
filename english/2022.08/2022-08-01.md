## English
There's research that shows the way we tell
our life stories directly affects the way we
feel about our lives. All those bruising falls,
on pavements, through relationships, can 
be given meaning retrospectively -- they 
weren't all simply your fault, they were
evidence of struggles. Of battles eventually
won.
