## English
Joy has cornered the cone market by
betting on a basic premise; When it comes
to the cone, people don't want
creativity. They want familiarity. Joy's
flagship factory in western Pennyvania
produces 15 to 20 million cones a day
during its busiest season. They include
squeaky cake cones; cookie-like sugar cones;
and cramel-scented waffle cones.
