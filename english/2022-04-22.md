## English
Chinese sientists have translated human somatic cells back into pluripotent stem cells,
an "adult" version of early embryonic cells, using chemical molecules.
A group of researchers led by Deng Hongkui from Peking University reported finding the chemical cellular reprogramming 
technique for the first time ever.
