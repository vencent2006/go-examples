## English
Instagram announced it's implementing
new teen account settings, all in an effort
to protect younger users from online
dangers on its platform. The new rules will
automatically make millions of teen
accounts private on the app. Teen users
will also receive time limit reminders,
nudging them to leave the app after
spending one hour on it each day. And
their accounts will default to sleep mode
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.
