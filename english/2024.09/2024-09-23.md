## English
Playing video games is one of the most
popular hobbies in the world. Globally, we
spend at least half a trillion hours a year
gaming, and that number only goes up.
90% of children play games. But people
often worry that games are a waste of time,
a bad influnce, or an unhealthy
compulsion. Gaming does have its pros
and cons. All we need to do is to maximize
the positives and minimize the negatives.
