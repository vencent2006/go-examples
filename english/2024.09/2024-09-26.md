## English
We all know how horrible it feels to be
thirsty. Human bodies need around 3 litres
of water a day, and thankfully most of us
can just turn on the kitchen tap to get
clean drinking water. But globally, over
two billion people, around a quarter of the
world's population, live in water stressed
countries, where access to water for
drinking, cooking, and washing is not
guaranteed.
