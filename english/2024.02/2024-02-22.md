## English
Japanese scientists have created one of the
world's most unusual spacecraft -- a tiny
satellite that is made of timber. The 
LignoSat probe has been built of magnolia
wood. If the LignoSat performs well during
its operation in orbit, then the door could
be opened for the use of wood as a 
construction material for more satellites.
