## English
A new study outlines how insomniacs
might take their condition even more
tiresome: clock-watching(or time-
monitoring behavior(TMB), to be
technical). It seems this can aggravate
insomnia, increase frustration, and lead to 
higher use of sleeping aids. It's a sort of
negative feedback loop. The more stressed
out you are, the harder time you're going
to have falling asleep.
