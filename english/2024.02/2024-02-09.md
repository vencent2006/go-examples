## English
Salmon is good for you - that part we
know. But What's so great about salmon?
Salmon packs more DHA and EPA
omega-3s than almost any other food,
apart from other fatty fish such as herring
and ardines. Studies have consistently
linked the consumption of omega-3 fatty
acids from seafood to lower rates of stroke
and heart disease.
