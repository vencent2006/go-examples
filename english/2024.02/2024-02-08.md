The Dragon symbolizes energy, wisdom,
protection, and good luck. We need these
qualities to rise to today's global
challenges. This year, the celecration at
the United Nation is special. For the first
time, the Lunar New Year is part of the UN
holiday calendar. I thank China and the
Chinese people for your unwavering
support to the United Nations, to 
multilateralism and global progress.
Together, we can realize a sustainable,
just, and peaceful future.
