## English
Apple released a new first-generation
product - the Vision Pro - a virtual reality
headset that resembles a pair of ski
goggles. The $3,500 wearable computer
uses cameras so people can see the outside
world while juggling apps and videos.
Apple called it a "spatial computer" that
blends together the physical and digital
worlds for people to work, watch movies
and play games.
