## English
Human voices cause considerably more
fear in wild mammals than the sound of
lions, a study has found. Scientists played
recordings of people talking normally
through speakers hidden at water holes in
the Kruger National Park. About 95% of
animals were extremely frightened and
quickly ran away. In contrast, recordings
of snarling and growling lions elicited
significantly less alarm.
