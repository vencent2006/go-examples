## English
A team of researchers at the Yonsei
University in Seoul, South Korea, managed
to create a rice hybrid laced with beef
protein and fat cells. The new pink rice has
8 percent more protein and 7 percent more
fat than regular rice, and while it doesn't
yet taste like beef, it does carry a "unique
blend of aromas, including a slight
nuttiness and umami which are
characteristic of meat".
