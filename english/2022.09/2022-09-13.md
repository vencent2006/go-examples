## English
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. Sometimes I stay in bed
until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window.
It was dark outside. 'What a day',I thought,'It's raining again.' Just then,
the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by traini,' she said.
'I'm coming to see you.'
   'But I'm still having breakfast', I said. 
   'What are you doing?', she asked.
   'I'm having breakfast', I repeated.
   'Dear me', she said.'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock.'
