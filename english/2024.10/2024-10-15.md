SpaceX completed its fifth test flight of its
giant Starship rocket on Sunday, achieving
the return of its booster back on the launch
pad. The rocket's "Super Heavy" booster
returned to land several minutes after
launch. The company used the arms of its
launch tower to catch the booster, a major
milestone toward SpaceX's goal of making
Starship a fully reusable rocket system.
