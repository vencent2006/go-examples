## English
A recent report shows the number of
Chinese students in the United States fell
by a small amount last year. Meanwhile, a
growing number of Chinese students are
choosing to go to less costly countries like
Britain and Australia. Experts say the cost
of studying in the U.S. and the tension
between the two countries are reasons for
the changing numbers.
