Some estimate that around 800 million
people globally are animated about anime.
In 2023, Japan's anime industry hit a
record high with revenues of 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars, up by nearly a quarter from a
year earlier. These days its export value in
Japan, alongside other content such as
video games, is approaching that of
semiconductors or steel.
