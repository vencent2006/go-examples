## English
Brain cells use a lot of nutrients. This
means they produce a lot of waste.
Scientists believe the brain has special
structures to take out this "cellular trash,"
especially during sleep. The brain is very
active during sleep. Scientists say the
failure to clear away such waste can lead to 
Alzheimer's diease and other brain disorders.
