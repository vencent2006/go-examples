## English
The White House confirmed Sunday that
Joe Biden will remain commander-in-chief
even as he abandons his pursuit of another
four years, saying he "looks forward to
finishing his term and delivering more
historic results for the American people."
The statement comes after Republicans
began openly calling for Biden to resign,
suggesting Biden should not be able to
remain on as president if he can't run for
reelection.
