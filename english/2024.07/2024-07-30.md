Apple dropped out of the top five
smartphone sellers in China for the first
time in four years in the second quarter,
with the iPhone losing ground to models
from domestic handset makers including
Huawei. While China's smartphone
shipment grew 8.9 per cent year over year
to 71.6mn units - a third consecutive
quarter of growth as the market recovers
from a slump - Apple saw a 3.1 per cent
decline.
