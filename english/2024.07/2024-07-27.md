## English
The BBC plans to cut 500 jobs as the UK
national broadcaster seeks more cost
savings after a savage real-term decline in
its funding from the licence fee over the
past decade. The publicly funded
broadcaster has registered a real-term fall
in income of close to a third since 2010 - a
difference of more than Â£1bn a year.
