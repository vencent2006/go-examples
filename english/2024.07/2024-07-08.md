## English
Anger is a normal emotion that everyone
feels - few of us stay serene when a driver
cuts us off or a boss makes us stay late.
But getting mad too often or for too long can
cause problems. It is bad for your health in
more ways than you think. It doesn't just
hurt your mental health. It hurts your
hearts, brains and gastrointestinal systems.

## words
