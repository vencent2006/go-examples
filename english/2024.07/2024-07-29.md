## English
A recent report said that scale of the
challenge facing the NHS was
"unprecedented" and that there was a
potential "growing mismatch" between
demand for services and future funding.
In the year 2023-24 "many NHS bodies failed
to break even" and that in future the
health service would be put under even
further pressure by an ageing population.
