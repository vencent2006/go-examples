July 21 clocked in at 17.09 degrees Celsius,
or 62.76 Fahrenheit, and was the hottest
day on Earth since at least 1940, according
to the preliminary data from the European
Union's Copernicus Climate Change
Service. It's the second consecutive year
average global temperatures have crashed
through shocking climate records and will
not be the last, as planet-warming fossil
fuel pollution drives temperatures to
shocking new highs.
