BYD has agreed a $1bn deal to build an
electric vehicle plant in Turkey, as China's
largest carmarker looks to increase its
European production and continue its
overseas expansion. The plant will be
capable of producing 150,000 vehicles a
year, said the Turkish government. It is
expected to begin production at the end of
2026 and create about 5,000 jobs.
