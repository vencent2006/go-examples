## English
Vice President Kamala Harris, the
Democratic nominee for president, has
chosen Gov. Time Walz of Minnesota as her
running mate. Time Walz is known for his
rural roots, liberal policies and buzzy
takedowns of former President Donald J.
Trump. Harris hopes that the former
football coach can appeal to working-class
voters in swing states to deliver a
Democratic vitory in November's US election.
