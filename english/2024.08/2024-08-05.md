## English
Dark chocolate is known for being rich in
plant nutrients called flavonoids,
antioxidants and beneficial minerals and
has been linked to improved
cardiovascular health, cognitive
performance and less chronic
inflammation. But a new study has found
that dark chocolate is contaminated with
lead and cadmium, two neurotoxic metals
that are linked to cancer, chronic diease
or reproductive and developmental issues.
