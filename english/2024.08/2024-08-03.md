## English
There are two main reason why Olympic
swimmers wear two - or sometimes more -
caps. One is that wearing multiple caps can
help to stablise an athlete's goggles. 
As well as adding additional tightness, a
second swimming cap can help cover up
the exposed straps around the goggles,
thus making the athlete more streamline
and reducing drag.
