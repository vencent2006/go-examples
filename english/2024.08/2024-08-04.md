## English
This year at the Paris Olympics, the gold
medals consist of 523 grams of silver,
coated in 6 grams of gold. Silver medals
weigh 525 gram and are made of pure
silver, while bronze medals weigh 455
grams and are made of copper, tin and
zinc. This year's Olympic medals will
depart slightly from their historical
tradition, with the Paris Olympic medals
including an iron piece from the Eiffel
Tower, on top of their usual composition.
