## English
The number of Chinese citizens living in
Malaysia has almost doubled over the past
three years, driven by a jump in students
and new investors. Today, there are easily
150,000, and it could even be 200,000
Chinese citizens in Malaysia, up from
about 82,000 in 2022, which is a very
conservative estimate.
