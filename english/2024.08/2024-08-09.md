## English
Why do swimmers wear down jackets
before competition? The main reason is to
keep warm, as muscles can stiffen up in
cold temperature. In colder
environments, the body initiates a series of
reactinos to keep the internal organs and
brain warm. During this process, muscles
contract uncontrollably to generate heat.
Before we feel the tremors, muscle
stiffness has already set in.
