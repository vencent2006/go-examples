## English
President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea
declared martial law on Tuesday night,
accusing the opposition of "trying to 
overthrow the free democracy." It was the
first martial law declaration in more than
four decades in South Korea. But about six
hours later, he lifted the declaration,
bowing to pressure after the National
Assembly unanimously passed a resolution
demanding that it end.
