More young people are being diagnosed
with stomach cancer. Early-stage stomach
cancer can be effectively treated through
surgical removal, but the five-year survival
rate drops to just six per cent for late-stage
cases of the disease. Experts advise young
individuals to prioritize their health and
not underestimate the significance of healthy habits.
