## English
Roughly one-fifth of people aged 16 to 65
perform no better in tests of maths and 
reading than would be expected of a pupil
coming to the end of their time at primary
school, according to a study released by
the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries.
Worse still, adults in many places have
grown less literate over the past ten years.
