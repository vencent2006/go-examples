## English
Food insecurity is not having consistent
access to enough food to meet one's basic
needs. Around the world, the U.N.
estimates that to be the case for 868
million people, with more than one-third
of those cases, 342 million people, being
severely food insecure. Those numbers
increased by a million people since the
U.N.'s last global report on food crises in
2023.
