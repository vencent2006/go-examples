## English
Estimates put the Avatar's production
budget alone at roughl6 $250 million. 
To illustrate how much the new Avatar would
have to bring in to break even, Cameron
said, "you have to be the third or fouth
highest-grossing film in history. That's
your threshold. That's your breakeven."
Any figure under $2 billion would be a 
loss.
