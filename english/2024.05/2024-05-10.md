## English
Journalists at Italy's influential public
broadcaster, RAI, went on strike on
Monday in a deepening confrontation with
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-
wing government. In a video statement, the
Union of Rai Journalists - which
represents about 75 percent of the 
broadcaster's 2,000 journalists - 
complained about editorial interference
and working conditions as they launched
what organisers say will be five, non-
consecutive days of labour action.
