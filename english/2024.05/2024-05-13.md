China's green industry, represented by
new energy vehicles, solar panels and 
lithium batteries, now boasts the highest
quality and the lowest production costs.
Other countries across the world can
benefit from these advantages and achieve
their own green goals at the lowest cost
possible. China hopes that the
technological advancements the country
has achieved can drive not only its
development but also that of other economies.
