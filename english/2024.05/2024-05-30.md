A new study has found connection
between drinking coffee and being less
likely to develop Parkinson's disease.
Looking at data collected on more than
180,000 individuals across an average of
13 years, the international team of
researchers behind the study found that
coffee consumers had a lower risk of
getting Pakinson's than those that didn't
drink coffee at all.
