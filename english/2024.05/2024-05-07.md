## English
According to legend, a 9th-century
Ethiopian goat-herder named Kaldi
observed his goats behaving erratically
after eating the red berries from a nearby
Coffea arabica tree. He tried some of them
himself and was soon acting as hyber as
his herd. Much like with tea, Kaldi put the
roasted beans into warm water and coffee
(the beverage) was born.
