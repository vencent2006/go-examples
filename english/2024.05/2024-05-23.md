Up to 50 percent of the world's rangelands
are degraded, endangering food security
and the wellbeing of billions, warned the
UN Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD) in a report on Tuesday.
Rangelands contitute 54 percent of
Earth's land cover, account for one sixth of
global food production and represent
nearly one third of the planet's carbon
reservoir.
