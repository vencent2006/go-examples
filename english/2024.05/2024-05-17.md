## English
China's plan to sell 1 trillion yuan in ultra-
long-term treasury bonds marks its latest
move to bolster fiscal support for the
economy, a step that experts say will 
stablize expectations, boost domestic
demand and shore up growth. The 
issuance of 1 trillion yuan in ultra-long
central special sovereign bonds will begin
on Friday and run until mid-November.
Three tensors are being planned - 20-year,
30-year and 50-year bonds.
