## English
Tour products to Europe have become hot
seller since early 2023 after China
loosened outbound travel restrictions
following the pandemic. Traditionally
popular European destinations such as
France, Spain and Greece remain top
choices for Chinese travelers, while "niche"
destinations like Serbia and Montenegro
have also become trendy. Deepening
tourism cooperation between China and
Europe will help vitalize the continent's
economy, as tourism is one of its pillar
industries.
