## English
It's a stereotype universally acknowledged
that a woman at room temperature must 
be in want of a coat. But is it a scientific
truth? A new study has surprised
researchers at the US National Institutes
of Health(NIH), finding no sex difference
in the perception of a cold room, and very
few sex differences in our physiological
response to it.
