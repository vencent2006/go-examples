## English
The tide of globalization is receding, at
least from American shores. Two
successive presidents have come down
firmly on the side of tariffs rather than
trade agreements as the preferred
machanism for managing international
commerce. History shows that the
aggressive and widespread imposition of
levies of this sort will restrain trade and
bring with it serious risks to economic
prosperity, both for the United States and 
for other affected countries.
