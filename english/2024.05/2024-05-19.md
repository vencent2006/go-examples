Five Israeli paratroopers were killed and
several injured when an Israeli tank fired
on them in the latest friendly-fire incident
during the country's war against Hamas
militants in the Gaza Strip. The Israel
Defense Forces said that a tank fired twice
at the troops, with an initial review
showing that it was likly the result of
misidentification during fierce fighting
with "Hamas in a dense[urban] area" in
