## English
Joe Biden is set to impose tariffs on
double-sided solar panel imports, as the
president moves to protect US clean
energy manufactures and boost jobs
ahead of November's election. The move
would immediately end an exemption
from Trump-era tariffs on imports of a
type of panel unit often used in large solar
projects, one of the fastest-growing forms
of clean energy in the country.
