## English
Studies showed that companies have
shifted away from emphasising financial
and operational skills towards social skills-
an ability to listen, reflect, communicate
and emphthise. Other research has
reached similar conclusions about jobs lower
down the pay scale: being able to work 
well with people is seen not as some
fluffy bonus but as a vital attribute.
