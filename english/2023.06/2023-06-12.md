## English
One explanation is a hangover from the
pandemic. When hotels, restaurants and
shops shut their doors amid lockdowns,
their workers' wages suffered
disproportionately. And those workers
were disproportionately women. If so, the
widening pay gap may have been a blip:
demand from employers in these sectors
has been hot since economies began to 
reopen.
