## English
Donald Trump is very likely to be the
Republican nominee. In 2016 and in 2020
it made some sense to think of the Trump
movement as hostile takeover of the
party. In 2023 it no longer does. He is the
front-runner because a large proportion of 
Republicans really like him. His
supporters have had their hands on the 
Republican National Committee for six
years now.
