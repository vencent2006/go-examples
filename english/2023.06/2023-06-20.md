## English
As we graduate and embark on the next
phases of their lives, one piece of advice
they will undoubtedly receive is to follow
their passions or some equivalent
sentiment. But it turns out to be a bad
idea. When asked to identify their
passions, women and men tend to cite
stereotypically feminine and masculine
interests and behavior.
