## English
What actually hampered students, it
turned out, were high levels of anxiety
during the weeks before the exam took
place. The greater a student's anxiety in
the days before the exam, the lower his or
her knowledge-gain was during that
period, leaving that student with less
material to regurgitate during the exam
itself.
