## English
The global decline in fertility rates, 
resulting in an aging population, will have
serious economic implications. The key to
meeting this challenge is to unleash the
potential of the poor through education
and skills training, while harnessing the
development of artificial intelligence and
robotics to cushion the economic impact of 
falling fertility.
