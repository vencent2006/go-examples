## English
"Sanction", can mean both " to approve of"
and " to lay a penalty upon". "Fast" can
mean speedy or stuck in place. "Cleave"
can mean to split, or to cling tightly.
"Fulsome" praise can be full-throated and 
genuine, or cloyingly insincere. One class
of Janus words is particularly
troublesome: those that mean different
things on opposite sides of the Atlantic.
