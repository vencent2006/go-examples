## English
This era of dearer money demands a shift
in how investors approach the markets. As
reality sinks in, they are scrambling to 
adjust to the new rules. They should focus
on three. One is that expected returns will
be higher. The second rule is that
investors' horizons can't be shortened. The
third rule is that investment strategies
need change.
