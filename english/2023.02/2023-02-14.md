## English
Going to the movies alone is arguably
better than going with someone else. Get a
ticket to a new film you've been dying to 
see, splurge on some popcorn and candy,
and have a date with yourself. Also, 
spending time with friends is a great
celebration of love that dosen't involve
romance. Invite all your favorite single
people over, cook an amazing dinner.
