## English
Research has found that solitary, non-
social activities tend to be inherently
calming and supportive of sleep. Reading a
book, doing some light yoga, and listening
to mellow music are all good pre-bed
activities. Boring is better.("Right now I'm
reading a book about the history of 
measurements," a researcher adds.)
