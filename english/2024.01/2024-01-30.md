## English
Blue light glasses gained popularity over
the past few years with the idea they
protect our eyes against screen usage - but
a new analysis shows they might not be as
beneficial to our eye health as previouly
hoped. Instead of shelling out money for 
special shades, however, experts advise
taking screen breaks. They recommend
small breaks away from screens every 20
minutes. That will make your eyes more comforable.
