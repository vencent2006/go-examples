### Shrek 1 - Opening Scene
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had
an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only
be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a 
castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave
knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,
but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the 
highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love, and true
love's first kiss...
(Laughing)
Like that's ever gonna happen.
