## English
The Taiwan question is China's internal
affair. Whatever changes take place in
Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only
one China in the world and Taiwan is part
of China will not change; the Chinese
government's position of upholding the
one-China principle and opposing "Taiwan
independence" separatism, "two Chinas"
and "one China, one Taiwan" will not
change; and the international community's
prevailing consensus on upholding the 
one-China principle and long-standing and
overwhelming adherence to this principle
will not change.
