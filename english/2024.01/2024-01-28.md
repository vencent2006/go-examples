In 2023, MacKenzie Scott unloaded nearly
65.3 million shares of Amazon, worth
more than $10.4 billion at Amazon's
Friday closing price, Bloomberg News
reported. After her divorce from Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos was finalized in 2019,
Scott became the wealthiest woman in the
world, receiving about 19.7 million shares,
equal to 4% of Amazon's total outstanding
shares. She was since sold off portions of 
her Amazon stake, donating billions of
dollars to charity.
