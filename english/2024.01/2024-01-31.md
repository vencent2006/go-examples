China consumed 1,089.7 metric tons of
gold last year, up 8.78 percent year-on-year,
according to data released by the 
China Gold Association. Growing risk-
aversion by investors due to a volatile
global financial environment has
contributed to the "gold risk". Gold
consumption will further grow in China
this year, driven by investors' appetete for
safe-haven assets.
