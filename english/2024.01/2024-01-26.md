## English
The population of giant pandas in the wild
in China is currently around 1,900, rising
from about 1,100 in the 1980s, the
National Forestry and Grassland
Administration said Thursday. To
effectively maintain the safety and 
sustainable development of the wild panda
population, China established the Giant
Panda National Park in October 2021,
which covers a total area of over 22,000
square kilometers and provides around 72
percent of wild giant pandas with
significant protection.
