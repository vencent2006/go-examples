## English
In countries around the world, women do
more unpaid labor - housework, child and
elder care, and the mental load of 
managing a family - than men. New
research suggests it takes a health toll on
many of them. Reducing the 
disproportionate unpaid labor burden on
women, by enabling men to take on their
equal share, has the potential to improve
women's mental health.
