## English
Gov.Ron DeSantis of Florida suspended
his campaign for president on Sunday and 
endorsed former President Donald J.
Trump, marking a spectacular implosion
for a candidate once seen as having the
best chance to dethrone Mr.Trump as the
Republican Party's nominee in 2024. His
departure leaves Nikki Haley, the former
governor of South Carolina, as Mr.
Trump's last rival standing.
