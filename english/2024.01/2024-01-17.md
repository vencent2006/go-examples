In China, Apple is slashing the price of
some of its latest iPhones by $70 amid
worries that Chinese consumers have
cooled on the brand. That would save a
buyer about 6 to 8 percent, based on prices
on Apple's China website. It has also
knocked $112 off the price of some
MacBook Air laptops. The sale will start on
Thursday and run through Sunday.
