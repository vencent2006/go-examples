## English
Eat That Frog
Clarity is the most important concept in personal productivity.
The number one reason why some people get more work done faster is
because they are absolutely clear about their goals and objectives
and they don't deviate from them.

A major reason for procrastination and lack of moviation is vagueness,
confusion and fuzzy mindedness about what you are supposed to do, and in
what order and for what reason. You must avoid this common condition with
all your strength by striving for ever greater clarity in everything you do.
