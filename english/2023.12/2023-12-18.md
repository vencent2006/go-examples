## English
Find Your Greatness
Greatness. It's just something we made up.
Somehow we've come to believe that
greatness is a gift, reserved for a chosen few
-- for prodigies, for superstars --
and the rest of us can only stand by watching.
You can forget that Greatness is not some rare
DNA strand. It's not some precious thing. Greatness
is no more unique to us than breathing. 
We're all capable of it, all of us.
