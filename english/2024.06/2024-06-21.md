## English
During this year's June 18 shopping
carnival, major Chinese e-commerce
platforms have adopted a more pragmatic
and simpler approach by canceling presale
campaigns, with a key focus on cost-
effective commodities and livestreaming to
bolster sales. Offline retail has been
integrated more into this year's online
shopping festival than in previous year.
