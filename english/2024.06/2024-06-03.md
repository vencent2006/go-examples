## English
Slouching is traditionally considered to be
a "bad" posture -- with some claiming it
will damage your spine and cause pain.
The great news is that in the past two
decades, there's been a plethora of
rigorous clinical studies conducted that
have concluded that there's no
relationship between slouching and spinal
pain.
