## English
SpaceX's launch of its giant Starship
rocket accomplished a set of ambitious
goals that Elon Musk, the company's chief
executive, set out before the test flight, its
fourth. The flight, while not a perfect
success, offered a sign that Mr.Musk's
vision of building the most powerful rocket
ever and making it resuable could again
transform a global space launch industry
that his company already dominates.
