## English
A recent study shows that even half an
hour of bird watching could make us
happier, healthier and help foster a deeper
connection with nature. The study
suggests that not only can bird watching
offer even more benefits than just listening
to birdsong, its more effective at
increasing well-being and reducing stress
than going on a nature walk.
