## English
Inside Out 2 has far exceeded ticket sale
predictions for its opening weekend. 
The film, which opened across the world on
Friday, had hit $155m at the US box office.
This makes it not only the highest-
performing film of the year so far but the 
first movie since last year's Barbie
($162m) to make over $100 on its opening weekend.
