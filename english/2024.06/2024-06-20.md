## English
Most supermarkets these days are
constantly looking for ways to speed up the
checkout process, and for good reason -
with time being such a valuable
commodity. Some people, however, just
can't be that fast and are often left feeling
guilty about moving too slowly.
A Japanese supermarket that implemented
an extra-slow checkout where customers
are never rushed recently reported a ten
percent increase in sales.
