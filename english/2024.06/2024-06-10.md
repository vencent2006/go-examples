## English
The dragon boat festival, believed to have
been celebrated for over 2,000 years, takes
place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar
month of the Chinese calendar throughout
China and in Chinese communities
worldwide. It commemorates the death of
Qu Yuan, China's first known poet, who
drowned himself when his home state of
Chu was overthrown; the dragon boat
races traditionally represent the search for
his body.
