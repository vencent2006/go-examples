## English
In moderate amounts, exposure to UV
radiation from sunlight helps our skin cells
to generate vitamin D. But as we expose
our skin to more sunlight, it tries to
protect itself by tanning through the
production of melanin. If the exposure is
too high, the skin can's protect itself and
you get a burn. This can lead to DNA
damage in our cells, which can cause
premature ageing.
