## English
Looking at any source of light, whether a
digital clock or phone, sends signals to the
brain to wake up and turn off production
of the sleep-promoting hormone
melatonin. Biological clocks help regulate
the timing of bodily processes, including
circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are
24-hour cycles that are part of the body's
internal clock, running in the background
to carry out essential functions and 
processes.
