China's university-entrance exam, known
as the gaokao, is the world's largest
academic test. More than 13.4 million
students registered for the exam this year,
surpassing last year's record of 12.9
million to make it the biggest "gaokao"
ever held in China. Work hard, score well
and, no matter what your social
background, you can get into a good
college.
