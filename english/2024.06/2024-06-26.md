When we're stressed out, many of us turn
to junk food for solace. But new research
suggests this strategy may bckfire.
The study found that in animals, a high-fat diet
disrupts resident gut bacteria, alters
behavior and, through a complex pathway
connecting the gut to the brain, influences
brain chemicals in ways that fuel anxiety.
