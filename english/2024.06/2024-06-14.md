## English
Experts usually recommend that people
apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before sun
exposure to allow time for it to absorb into
the skin. It might be wise to apply it twice,
since studies show that most people tend
to underapply sunscreen. Experts also
advise reapplying sunscreen after
sweating, being immersed in water, or if
our skin has rubbed up against clothing or
sand.
