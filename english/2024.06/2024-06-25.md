## English
The IMF said it had "profound concerns"
about massive labour disruptions and
rising inequality as societies move towards
generative AI, and it urged governments to 
do more to protect their economies.
The fund said countries should take action
such as improving unemployment
insurance, warning that, unlike past
disruptive technologies, AI could lead to
job losses in higher-skilled occupations.
