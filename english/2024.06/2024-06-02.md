## English
The IMF said it has upgraded its forecast
for China's gross domestic product growth
in 2024 to 5 per cent, from 4.6 per cent.
It also increased its forecast for 2025 to 4.5
per cent, from 4.1 per cent. The change 
was driven by the country's stronger first-
quarter growth and recent policy
initiative, the multilateral lender said.
