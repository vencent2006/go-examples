## English
The Los Angeles Lakers have LeBron James. They have Anthony Davis. And, crucially, they have a real supporting cast.

After spending much of the regular season in a dysfunctional state, the Lakers were a complete team on Friday as they finished off the Memphis Grizzlies in their first-round series with a 125-85 win in Game 6. They will advance to face the winner between the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors, who play a Game 7 on Sunday.
